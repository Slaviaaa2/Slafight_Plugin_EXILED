# Repository Instructions

## Scope

This repository contains the Sharp Server SCP: Secret Laboratory plugin built on
EXILED. It targets `net48` and is tightly integrated with the server's ProjectMER,
HintServiceMeow, SNAPI-HSM, audio, map, and Unity asset stack.

Treat the current source, project files, local dependency assemblies, and sibling
repositories as the source of truth. Do not assume that upstream ProjectMER,
HintServiceMeow, EXILED examples, old MapEditorReborn APIs, or remembered version
numbers match this server.

Before changing anything:

1. Check this repository's Git status.
2. Check every sibling repository that will be read from or modified.
3. Read the relevant `.csproj`, source entry points, registration, and cleanup paths.
4. Inspect exact referenced assemblies with `ilspycmd` when source is unavailable.
5. Preserve unrelated local changes and keep commits separated by repository.

## Required build

Before completing any task, build the solution in Release mode:

```powershell
dotnet build .\Slafight_Plugin_EXILED.sln --configuration Release
```

The project targets EXILED `9.14.2`, copies the built plugin automatically to
`%APPDATA%\EXILED\Plugins\7777`, and copies its managed runtime dependencies to
`%APPDATA%\EXILED\Plugins\dependencies`.

Never report a successful build or deployment without checking the command result.
For deployment verification, compare the output and destination timestamps or
SHA-256 hashes.

## Family repositories

These repositories form one server feature stack. They are separate Git
repositories and must not be committed as if they were one working tree. Do not
assume where a contributor cloned them; discover sibling checkouts from the current
workspace or ask for their locations when they are required.

| Component | Repository | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slafight | `https://github.com/SharpServer/Slafight_Plugin_EXILED` | Main EXILED plugin, roles, items, events, HUD, maps, and server behavior |
| ProjectMER | `https://github.com/SharpServer/ProjectMER` | LabAPI schematic loader, map objects, markers, animation, and spawn/update/despawn behavior |
| HintServiceMeow | `https://github.com/SharpServer/HintServiceMeow` | Shared hint compositor and the EXILED output plugin |
| Unity assets | `https://github.com/SharpServer/SL-CustomObjects-dev` | Unity 2021.3.17f1 source for ProjectMER schematics and asset bundles |
| MapWorks | `https://github.com/SharpServer/ProjectMER-MapWorks` | Live `Maps`, `Schematics`, and exported asset bundles; the configured export directory may itself be this Git working tree |
| SL references | `https://github.com/SharpServer/SL_References` | Exact local compile/decompilation assemblies shared by the family projects |

Important boundaries:

- Unity exports schematics directly into the MapWorks working tree configured by
  `Assets/config.json`.
- Editing Unity source does not automatically mean exported MapWorks data changed,
  and editing MapWorks JSON does not update Unity source.
- Each repository's `.claude\settings.local.json` is machine-local permission state.
  Do not commit it unless the user explicitly requests that exact file.
- `SL_References` is a development reference mirror, not a runtime plugin directory.

## Build and deployment matrix

### Slafight

```powershell
dotnet build .\Slafight_Plugin_EXILED.sln --configuration Release
```

Automatic destinations:

- `%APPDATA%\EXILED\Plugins\7777\Slafight_Plugin_EXILED.dll`
- `%APPDATA%\EXILED\Plugins\dependencies\` for copied managed dependencies

### ProjectMER

Run from the ProjectMER checkout:

```powershell
dotnet build .\ProjectMER.csproj --configuration Release
```

Its Release target automatically copies `ProjectMER.dll` to:

- `%APPDATA%\SCP Secret Laboratory\LabAPI\plugins\7777`
- `%SL_References%`

### HintServiceMeow

Run from the HintServiceMeow checkout:

```powershell
dotnet build .\HintServiceMeow.sln --configuration Release
dotnet build .\HintServiceMeow\HintServiceMeow.csproj --configuration Exiled
```

The runtime assembly is `bin\Exiled\HintServiceMeow-Exiled.dll`. HSM has no local
post-build deployment target, so copy that exact file manually to:

- `%APPDATA%\EXILED\Plugins\7777`
- `%SL_References%`

### Unity schematics

- Required editor: Unity `2021.3.17f1`.
- Project: the contributor's `SL-CustomObjects-dev` checkout.
- Export destination:
  `%APPDATA%\SCP Secret Laboratory\LabAPI\configs\ProjectMER\Schematics`.
- After editor script changes, wait for compilation and check the Unity Console.
- Validate generated JSON and asset bundles before committing the MapWorks repository.

## Runtime layout for port 7777

```text
%APPDATA%\EXILED\Plugins\7777\
  Slafight_Plugin_EXILED.dll
  HintServiceMeow-Exiled.dll
  SNAPI-HSM.dll

%APPDATA%\EXILED\Plugins\dependencies\
  0Harmony.dll
  AudioPlayerApi.dll
  SCPSLAudioApi.dll
  ...managed/audio dependencies

%APPDATA%\SCP Secret Laboratory\LabAPI\plugins\7777\
  ProjectMER.dll
  MEROptimizerLabAPI.dll

%APPDATA%\SCP Secret Laboratory\LabAPI\configs\ProjectMER\
  Maps\
  Schematics\
```

Do not copy a LabAPI plugin into EXILED or an EXILED plugin into LabAPI merely
because both are used by Slafight.

## Network and lifecycle invariants

This server creates real players, dummy NPCs, internal NPCs, and partially
authenticated hubs during round transitions. Network code is therefore sensitive
to object lifetime and authentication state.

- For client-bound messages, `connection.isReady` alone is insufficient. A real
  client must also be `ClientInstanceMode.ReadyClient`.
- HSM is the central last-line guard for hint delivery. Do not scatter redundant
  NPC checks through every HUD loop.
- `Player.ShowHint` is allowed and is the intended way to show a one-shot hint. It
  works only because HSM's `use_hint_compatibility_adapter` is enabled in
  `%APPDATA%\EXILED\Configs\Plugins\HintServiceMeow\7777.yml`, which absorbs
  EXILED/vanilla `TextHint` calls into HSM. If that setting is turned off, hints fall
  back to the vanilla `HintDisplay` and flicker against the HUD. The adapter fixes the
  Y position near 700 and reads size and per-line alignment from the rich text, so a
  caller cannot pass coordinates; adjust with `<size>`, newlines, or `<voffset>`.
  Keep `Slafight_Plugin_EXILED` out of HSM's `DisabledCompatAdapter` list.
- Do not use `HintAlignment.Right` for HSM hints. Only the Right path goes through
  `<margin-right>` plus aspect-ratio correction, so the column drifts with resolution.
  Use `Center` with an `XCoordinate`, or split the block into one hint per line.
- Use `PlayerSafetyExtensions.IsSafePlayer` / `IsNotHost` for Slafight player
  targeting. Non-NPC players must be verified; legitimate NPC flows remain
  supported.
- Do not use a `ReferenceHub` or another destroyed Unity object as a delayed
  `HashSet`/`Dictionary` key. Prefer stable `netId` keys, verify object identity
  when the callback runs, and invalidate pending work on round restart.
- Preserve registration symmetry and round cleanup for events, Harmony patches,
  coroutines, dictionaries, spawned objects, and network state.
- Avoid adding `IsNPC` filters to non-player-facing systems without evidence; many
  custom roles, turrets, hitboxes, and schematic interactions intentionally use
  NPCs.

## Chaos Keycard Snake sessions

- A Chaos Keycard owner creates a local `SnakeEngine` with a non-null delta sender.
  That engine intentionally ignores server-authored messages, including full
  resyncs. A public `ServerSendMessage` therefore updates observers but not the
  owning client's display.
- To show server-authored content to the owner, send that owner a targeted
  `KeycardItem.MsgType.Custom` / `ChaosMsgType.NewConnectionFullSync` RPC first.
  This clears and recreates the owner's `ChaosKeycardItem.SnakeSessions` as
  server-controlled engines. Preserve every known session in that full sync and
  replace only the intended serial's frame.
- `NewConnectionFullSync` clears every Chaos Keycard Snake session on the receiving
  client. Restrict this takeover to dedicated content such as the Bad Apple test
  item; do not enable it as the general API default.
- Inspecting the card still advances its original local engine and sends Snake
  move deltas. SNAPI raises `SnakeMove` for those automatic moves, not only for
  explicit direction input, so takeover playback must not use that event as an
  immediate stop condition.
- The native display renders an ordered, connected Head/Middle/Tail snake, not an
  arbitrary pixel framebuffer. Disconnected silhouette coordinates can render
  with gaps and produce invalid-neighbor warnings.
- For pixel-like images, `SnakeImageOptions.RenderSolidPixels` alternates the
  selected cells between each row's extrema so the display chooses its square
  fallback sprite. It connects rows through off-screen, same-axis bridge segments
  to avoid diagonal-neighbor warnings and stays below the 255-segment wire limit.
- Prefer `SnakeMediaApi.PlayPixelMedia` for synchronized URL/file video and
  Spatial audio instead of recreating download tasks, clip caches, playback
  dictionaries, or unequip cleanup in each CItem. Its timeline is anchored to the
  decoded audio duration and skips late video frames rather than accumulating
  `WaitForSeconds` drift.
- Choose image behavior through `SnakeImageRenderStyle`: `NativeSnake` preserves
  directional body sprites, `SolidPixels` forces square cells, and
  `AbstractSilhouette` normalizes foreground polarity and repairs small gaps and
  diagonal details according to `AbstractionLevel`. Implement
  `ISnakeImageFrameRenderer` when a feature needs its own segment ordering or a
  hybrid of native Snake parts and fallback pixels.

## ProjectMER and schematic rules

- Search the exact ProjectMER fork before using an API; this fork contains
  server-specific bridges and object-prefab metadata that upstream examples may
  not have.
- Negative-scale normalization is safe only where the occupied primitive geometry
  is preserved. Do not blindly take the absolute scale of parent transforms; that
  mirrors child positions and can break intentional shear hierarchies.
- Plane/Quad conversions must preserve local axes, dimensions, normal direction,
  collider behavior, and children. Current ProjectMER converts eligible leaf
  Planes to Quads at runtime.
- Do not bulk rewrite or re-export all MapWorks data for a narrow source change.
  Inspect generated diffs and keep Unity source and exported data commits separate.

## Logs and diagnosis

Local paths:

- Main server log:
  `%APPDATA%\SCP Secret Laboratory\LocalAdminLogs\7777\`
- Client log:
  `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Northwood\SCPSL\Player.log`
- EXILED configuration:
  `%APPDATA%\EXILED\Configs\Plugins\<plugin>\7777.yml`
- LabAPI configuration:
  `%APPDATA%\SCP Secret Laboratory\LabAPI\configs\`

For disconnects, protocol errors, rendering errors, or client crashes, inspect the
client `Player.log` together with the matching LocalAdmin log. For live incidents,
the production server runs on a remote VPS; local logs and local plugin folders do
not prove what the VPS loaded. Request the VPS LocalAdmin log and confirm its DLL
versions or hashes.

## Configuration discipline

- Avoid adding fields to `Config.cs` for test features, one-off content, or values
  used by only one item/role/component.
- Prefer scoped `const` or `static readonly` values in the owning class for those
  cases. Promote a value to `Config.cs` only when server operators genuinely need
  to change it at runtime or the user explicitly requests configuration support.
- Keep test-content constants close to their implementation. For example, the
  Bad Apple test source, FPS, and frame limit belong in
  `CustomItems/SlafightApiItems/BadAppleTestPlayer.cs`.
- Do not edit `Config.cs` incidentally while implementing unrelated features.

## Git and completion

- Keep Slafight, ProjectMER, HSM, Unity assets, MapWorks, and SL references as
  independent commits and pushes.
- Never mix pre-existing user work into a new implementation commit without
  explicit direction. If the user requests a clean baseline, commit and push that
  existing work first as a separate commit.
- Do not reset, clean, discard, or rewrite unrelated changes.
- Before finishing, review every affected repository's final diff/status, run the
  required builds, verify deployment, and state any behavior that still requires a
  server restart or remote VPS validation.
